        <b>Short Intro</b><br>
        BD is a 2003 kid who learns to play instruments by herself. She also likes to learn foreign languages 
        and watch some mystery k-dramas when she’s available. She’s not ambitious at school and tends to look 
        for other activities.
        <br><br>
        <b>Music Journey</b> <br>
        Back in 2009, when her brother had to go to a pop keyboard course for his therapy, she asked to join 
        him. But unfortunately, two months after learning just very basic lessons, she broke her arm. She quit 
        her keyboard course and since then she didn’t have the intention to join any music course. After that 
        accident, she was registered to join a pop vocal course, which she didn’t know she didn’t like. After 
        three to four years, she quit.
        <br><br>
        In elementary school, when BD was around 10, she started to be interested in guitar, so she joined her 
        school’s music ensemble that consisted of children who played melodicas, recorders, xylophone, 
        triangle, castanets, and guitars. She learnt to play some basic chords, however she didn’t explore 
        more so her guitar skills hadn’t improved for years. She also played melodica and recorder as it was 
        compulsory for all students to learn how to play those instruments in her elementary school. When she 
        was 12 she took classical singing lesson for only three months because she had a vocal problem.
        <br><br>
        In the second term of 7th grade, her interest in playing piano grew. She started to teach herself 
        piano (before she had a piano she learnt using keyboard) by experimenting, without any structured 
        learning plan. At that time she had forgotten every lesson she got from her previous keyboard course, 
        and it can be said that she started from scratch. Since she never uses sheet music to play piano, she 
        is used to play by ear.
        <br><br>
        Playing piano made her discover Jazz music. This allows her to be keener in making harmony and it helps 
        her play "more-than-just-the-root" chords, without even knowing the name of the chords. She has also 
        tried to make one-woman  (feminine version of the word "one-man" lol) acapella audios. 
        <br><br>
        As her skill improves—even though it’s still mediocre—, she has taken part in church services, school 
        events/performances, and birthday events. 
        <br><br>
        Playing piano helped her regain the eagerness to improve her guitar skills, after ignoring it for 
        years. In the 8th grade she started off by practising more complex chords and currently is trying to 
        play finger style.
        <br><br>
        In high school, she chose music for her art class. She studied some basic music theories and got to 
        know an application to make sheet music. Now she doesn’t have to be able to read sheet music to write 
        one, because she can listen to it by using the application.<br><br><br></p>
